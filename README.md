# image-to-latex
LaTeX is a document preparing system. It is mostly used by professionals to accommodate their
needs. Texmaker is an IDE which provides an environment for LaTeX typesetting system.
Professionals prefer and use LaTeX typesetting system to write research paper, thesis and much
more as it provides precision and accuracy. Well, where it provides precision, it also comes up
with a headache. Writing in LaTeX format is not an easy thing. There are some tags, preambles,
commands, starting/closing body and formattingâ€™s used to write a document. A lot of time is
required to prepare a single document. We came up with the idea that, let the application do that
hard work.
Image to LaTeX will be an Android based application using Java programming language. The
idea is to reduce the time period of writing document by pre-set all tags and commands (require
to prepare the document in LaTeX) through this application and a new way of writing which is
fetching text from image. So, application is more likely performing as a template to prepare a
LaTeX document. It fetches the text from the Image. I-e, crisp and clear through using
smartphones camera or choose it from gallery with an amazing cropping option (I-e, select text
area in image to crop it and use it) to generate an editable text file with .tex extension (LaTeX
document extension) which then further, generates a pdf version of that file using Texmaker.
